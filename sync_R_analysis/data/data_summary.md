-   `topcount` contains the raw files for each plate measured in the luminescence experiments in three sub-folders for each conditions (short day to long day shift (SD_LD), short day control (SD_SD) and long day control (LD_LD)).
-   `variant_calling` contains the vcf files for control and treatment RNA-seq against the TAIR10 transcriptome.
